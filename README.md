# FuzzyController_for_Traffic_Light_System
 Using a Fuzzy Logic algorithm to control the traffic light system at a given intersection.
 
 This system aim is to simulate a traffic light scenario at a typical 4 ways junction.
 Fuzzy Logic Controller is used to control the traffic light change and duration.
 For the fuzzy logic controller, Mamdani method and Triangular member function are used for the fuzzification.
 Centroid method is used for the defuzzification.
 
 There are 4 inputs and 2 outputs for the fuzzy logic controller.
 The inputs: Numbers of car at Junction1, Junction 2, Junction 3 and Junction 4.
 The outputs: The duration of Green light and Next junction to turn green.
 There are 160 rules used to implement the system (check the source code).
 
 The results are as below:

 Legend: The numbers in the figure represent the number of cars at the junction during that time.
